Code snippets are portions of code or markup with syntax highlight. Helpinator allows you to manage code snippets using snippet library and embed them into topics using special placeholders. Though Helpinator is not intended to document source code, code snippets allow you to document APIs, HTML/XML samples and other supplementary code.
